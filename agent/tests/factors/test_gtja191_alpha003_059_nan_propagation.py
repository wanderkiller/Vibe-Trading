"""Regression: gtja191_003 and gtja191_059 must propagate NaN through a
data gap instead of fabricating a 0.0 "unchanged" move.

Both alphas compute a signed daily move that is 0.0 on a real tie
(close == prior close) and otherwise close minus a reference price, then
sum it over a rolling window. compute() picks the tie branch with
``(c - ref).where(up | dn, 0.0)`` where ``up``/``dn`` are comparisons
against the prior close. A NaN comparison evaluates False, not NaN, so a
missing close or prior close (a halt, a gap) reads exactly like a real
tie and gets the fabricated 0.0 instead of NaN — the same class of bug
already fixed in gtja191_004. base.py's own NaN policy ("every operator
propagates NaN; no silent fillna") requires the gap to stay NaN through
every window that still touches it.
