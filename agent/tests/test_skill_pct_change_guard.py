"""Every ``pct_change`` a skill hands the agent must state its fill policy.

pandas 2.x still defaults ``Series.pct_change`` to ``fill_method='pad'``: a
missing close is forward-filled, so the gap bar reports a **0.0% return** that
never happened and the following bar reports the two-day move as a one-day move.
Both are fabricated observations, not a bias with a known sign -- the rolling
volatility built on them can land either side of the truth depending on the
data. pandas already emits a FutureWarning for the implicit default and removes
it in 3.0, but this repo pins ``pandas>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`` (pyproject.toml), so the
padding is live in every supported version.

Skill files are not inert documentation: the agent reads these examples and
templates and runs what it copies, so a padded ``pct_change`` there becomes a
padded ``pct_change`` in a user's strategy. This guard is repo-wide because the
defect arrived one file at a time (#1397 and #1398 each fixed a single call
site while eleven more sat untouched, two of them in files those same PRs
edited).

Equity-curve returns in ``backtest/`` are deliberately out of scope: the engine
builds that series with a value on every bar and ``metrics.py`` documents its
``.fillna(0.0)`` choice at the seam.
