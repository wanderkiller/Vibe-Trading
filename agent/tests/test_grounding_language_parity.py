"""The gate must reach the same verdict in every language it reads.

The gate used to key on a phrase list, and a phrase list is written in
whatever language the bug report arrived in. Twice that left it strictly
leakier on one side than the other:

- ``\\bclose\\b`` does not match "closed at", which is how an answer actually
  states an observed price. "The stock closed at 412.35." with zero tool calls
  passed, while "该股收盘 412.35。" — the same fabricated claim — was caught.
- Chinese had the mirror-image hole: 成交价 / 最新价 / 股价 / 收报 are as
  ordinary as 收盘价 and none of them matched.

There is no phrase list any more: a number's role is declared by the model and
its shape is language-independent. This file is what proves the property
survived the change, so the assertion is deliberately NOT a literal per
language. Each case runs the same figure through both spellings and asserts
the two verdicts are EQUAL.

Both arms are pinned. A gate whose tests only assert rejection cannot see
itself closing on everything.
