"""Percentage-point deltas: one shape, one verdict, in both languages.

Regression history for HKUDS/Vibe-Trading#1341: the price scan masked "%" but
not the percentage-point spellings, so "~3.6pp below Penumbra" yielded 3.0 (the
".6" consumed as a decimal) and that number reached the OHLC comparator as an
unsourced price claim — rejecting a correct fundamentals answer and demanding
`get_market_data` to substantiate a statement that had nothing to do with
price. The mask that fixed it then had to grow: 个百分点 and 基点 were missing,
the Chinese measure word broke the word boundary, and each gap was one more
rejected answer.

There is no mask now. A percentage-point delta is a decimal, which is
measurement-shaped, which means the model declares what it is — and the twelve
spellings below stop being twelve cases. What this file pins is that they are
ONE case: the same shape, the same verdict, whatever unit token trails the
number and whichever language it is written in.
