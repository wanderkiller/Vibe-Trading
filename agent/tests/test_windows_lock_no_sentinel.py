"""The Windows lock path must not write a sentinel byte into an empty file.

`msvcrt.locking` locks a byte RANGE, and on Windows a range beyond EOF is a
valid lock target — so an empty file can be locked at offset 0 without writing
anything. The previous implementation seeked to EOF and wrote ``b"\\0"`` first
to give itself a byte to lock. For the compliance ledger that sentinel is a
malformed line 0, so `_walk_chain` raised `LedgerCorruptionError` on the very
first append and the ledger was unusable on Windows.

These tests exist because that path is unreachable on POSIX: `msvcrt` is None
here, so the branch never runs and a regression would be invisible to every
non-Windows contributor and to the Linux and macOS CI jobs. Rather than trust
a reviewer's Windows run, the module-level `fcntl` / `msvcrt` handles are
swapped for stubs so the Windows branch executes on every platform.

The assertions are deliberately behavioural, not "was locking() called":
a test that only checks the call would stay green if the sentinel came back.
