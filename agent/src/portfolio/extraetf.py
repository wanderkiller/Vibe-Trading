"""Read-only reader for extraETF portfolio exports.

extraETF exports two semicolon-delimited, German-locale files:

``holdings`` — the positions of one view at export time::

    ISIN;Name;Typ;Anzahl;Kaufpreis;Aktueller Kurs;Aktueller Wert;Währung;Wechselkurs;Region;Land;Sektor;Portfolioname;Portfolio ID

``transactions`` — the movement history of one view::

    Datum;ISIN;Name;Typ;Transaktion;Anzahl;Preis;Gebühren;Steuern;Währung;Wechselkurs;Portfolioname;Portfolio ID;Stückzinsen

Three properties are deliberate and load-bearing.

**A transactions export can never be read as a portfolio.** Its rows are
movements — ``Kauf``/``Verkauf``/``Dividende``/``Einbuchung``/``Ausbuchung`` —
not holdings. An allocation computed from trades looks perfectly plausible and
is wrong, so the two formats are told apart by their header and positions are
reachable only through :meth:`ExtraEtfExport.require_positions`, which refuses
any other export. Movements carry an explicit ``movement_kind`` so a dividend or
a transfer is never mistaken for a trade.

**A holdings export carries no date.** The format has no snapshot column, so
freshness can only come from the file's own modification time, and the export
exposes it as ``source_mtime``, with ``as_of_source`` recording where it came
from. It is named for what it is — a file's modification time, not an
observation time and not a snapshot date. No position carries an observation
time at all: ``updated_at`` is ``None`` rather than a copy of the file's mtime.
Copying or syncing an export rewrites that mtime, so ``source_mtime`` reports
when the *file* last changed and nothing more.

**Validation fails closed.** A row this reader does not recognise raises
:class:`ExtraEtfFormatError` instead of being skipped: an import computed from
90% of a portfolio reads as entirely plausible, whereas a refused import is
merely annoying. That covers ragged rows, records that span more than one
physical line, unknown or missing columns, unreadable or contradictory numbers,
numbers carrying more precision than the output can hold, empty required
fields, text fields carrying control characters, an instrument listed twice
under one portfolio, and a transaction whose label or identifier cannot be read
as anything this format documents.

The number rule is precise, because it is the one that can change a position's
size by orders of magnitude. A comma is the decimal separator and a period may
only be a thousands separator, so ``1.386,608`` is 1386.608 and ``12,3456`` is
12.3456. A value whose separators are US-ordered (``1,234.56``) is refused,
because reading it as German would be wrong by a thousandfold. A period grouping
that is not a plain thousands separator — a first group longer than three
digits, or a later group that is not exactly three (``1.23``, ``1234.56``,
``1234.567``) — is refused too, because it is neither a valid German number nor
safely a US one. What is *not*
refused is a period-grouped value that is valid German — ``1.900`` is 1900 — and
that reading is a convention of the format, not a deduction: ``1.900`` could be
1.9 in a US-locale file, and no amount of parsing can tell the two apart.
extraETF writes German, so German wins, and a file that had been round-tripped
through a US-locale spreadsheet is caught by the *other* values in it rather
than by this one.

Rows are read by column name, so a reordered export cannot mis-align a value
into the wrong column. Rows are **never** merged or de-duplicated silently. The
same instrument under two different portfolio IDs is two real positions and is
left alone. The same instrument twice under **one** portfolio ID is refused:
the two rows could be one lot listed twice or two genuine lots, and a caller
that sums them double-counts the position while a caller that keeps one drops
the other, so the file is rejected rather than guessed at.

The emitted position uses the portfolio package's own field names so a container
can consume it, and carries the export's remaining columns alongside them. It
does **not** route the row through
:func:`src.portfolio.normalization.normalize_position`, which is the obvious way
to guarantee one wire shape, because that function stamps ``updated_at`` with
the current time — an observation time this reader never made — and defaults an
unknown instrument class to ``"stock"``. Both are fabrications a file import
must not make, so the mapping is done here and the divergences are shown above:
``quote_symbol``'s None, ``asset_type``'s None, ``market``'s None (the
connector path stamps the broker there), and ``updated_at`` against
``source_mtime``.

Values are carried as the export reports them rather than repaired: a zero or
negative quantity, a zero FX rate, and two different portfolio names under one
portfolio ID all pass through, because a reader that silently corrects its input
is a reader whose output no longer describes the file. What is refused is input
that cannot be read at all.

Two limits are inherent to the format and belong in the caller's hands. A file
truncated exactly at a record boundary is indistinguishable from a short export,
because neither format carries a row count or a footer; a caller that knows how
many positions to expect is the only thing that can catch that. An export with a
header and no rows is read as a valid empty portfolio, because an empty
portfolio and an unreadable file are different states.

The module writes nothing, holds no credentials, and touches no network. It
only reads a local file the user exported themselves, and it has no path to any
order surface.
